                <p>Mythos is an experimental publication which seeks to elevate poetry to the world of visual art through elegant typographic form. It is partly an anthology of the greatest poems and essays on poetic theory including writers like Shakespeare, Marcus Aurelius, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Walt Whitman, as well as excerpts from the Bible and the Vedas. By peering through the die-cut holes in the page, the reader can trace the soul of language which connects all these writings from the origins of civilization to the current day. Each page exists as a work of art on its own, and yet leads into the next through the holes in its surface; every page exists in constant conversation with the whole publication. As the climatic poetic essay in the middle of Mythos states in the reveal of a gate fold, “Consciousness is formed from the dialogue of people.”  </p>

                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>The journey with Mythos began first with curating a collection of poetry that focused on language and mysticism. Some included favorited poets and philosphers, some was commissioned, and some was written by me. I arranged the poems into three sections, the origin of language, the consciousness of language, and the providence of language. The holes die-cut into the pages become bigger as you read, symbolizing the idea of the soul’s journey from birth to death. As poetry is an intimate experience between poet to reader, the journey of language and the soul are intertwined, just as each poem intertwines into the next in the interaction of the holes between pages.</p>
