                       <p>Hey, I’m Lauren Roberts, a Graphic and UI/UX designer originally from Southern California. I recently graduated from Drexel University with a B.S. in Graphic Design, and minors in fine art, art history, and UI/UX Design. In my work, I’m interested in the role design has in meaningful connection between individuals, whether that’s in impactful and personal branding, immersive user experiences, or bridging the gap between fine art and design. My Senior Capstone, which will be finished by the end of Spring 2022, aims to reconceptualize the art museum as a digital exhibition to provide a more accessible and immersive experience.</p>
                       <p>Throughout my time at Drexel, I was featured in Design Philadelphia 2021, most notably for my experimental publication Mythos, and served as a designer in the largest undergraduate club at Drexel, Campus Activity Board. I’ve also worked with Aramark / Drexel Business Services designing for Drexel’s dining halls, and created the brand guidelines and press kit for my 6 month long co-op at Social Ladder, as well as assisting on web design. In between classes and other jobs, I also work as a freelance designer for an online magazine.</p>
                       <p>I am also a poet/writer and am working on my first chapbook of poetry. I currently live in Philly with my adorable cat, Olive, and am frequently in NYC browsing art museums, record shops, and thrift stores. Whether you wanna go out for some chai, follow each other on Spotify, or contact me for freelance work, feel free to check out my resume and send an email.</p>
