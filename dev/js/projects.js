Each part of the MET Cloisters is sourced from different areas of medieval Europe, and this poster color codes each location so viewers can trace the origin of either an art piece or an architectural form back from where it was taken. With the rhythm of blackletter typography, shattered panes of hyper-saturated artwork and architecture, and the background grid phasing in and out from the foreground, the design brings to life the diverse beauty of the MET Cloisters and explodes its history into view.

The Panchatantra is a series of Indian stories, akin to Aesop’s Fables with animal characters and moralistic meanings, and brings a sense of community, history, and playfulness to the brand. Inspired both by the animals from the stories and the geometric patterns of textiles from India, the resulting product is a bright and illustrative twist on ornate vintage design. Panchatantra Chai is steeped in the ancient history of chai and oral tradition in India, while still marketed towards a diverse culturally-sensitive population. As the recipe card inside the package alludes to, tea should be a communal as well as delicious experience.",

        description: "Mythos is an experimental publication which seeks to elevate poetry to the world of visual art through elegant typographic form. It is partly an anthology of the greatest poems and essays on poetic theory including writers like Shakespeare, Marcus Aurelius, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Walt Whitman, as well as excerpts from the Bible and the Vedas. By peering through the die-cut holes in the page, the reader can trace the soul of language which connects all these writings from the origins of civilization to the current day. Each page exists as a work of art on its own, and yet leads into the next through the holes in its surface; every page exists in constant conversation with the whole publication. As the climatic poetic essay in the middle of Mythos states in the reveal of a gate fold, “Consciousness is formed from the dialogue of people",
        process_description: "The journey with Mythos began first with curating a collection of poetry that focused on language and mysticism. Some included favorited poets and philosphers, some was commissioned, and some was written by me. I arranged the poems into three sections, the origin of language, the consciousness of language, and the providence of language. The holes die-cut into the pages become bigger as you read, symbolizing the idea of the soul’s journey from birth to death. As poetry is an intimate experience between poet to reader, the journey of language and the soul are intertwined, just as each poem intertwines into the next in the interaction of the holes between pages.",

Anatomy of an Artist takes inspiration from graffiti and the unique presence of the media in Basquiat’s career by using a quote motif throughout the catalog, along with bold type and experimental layouts. In one chapter, Basquiat’s Untitled Skull painting is dissected with each turn of the page, as the reader unveils quotes from critics, until eventually, the painting is fully gone and all that remains is a statement on Basquiat’s failing mental state, and his habit of destroying his own artwork. The overall catalog chronologically traces Basquat’s artistic origins and throughout his career through the theme of body and anatomy frequently analyzed in Basquiat’s artwork, highlighting both the successes of his career and struggles in his personal life.",

Finally, it raises questions of who is actually consuming art and asks how representational of its community is the art museum.",

A trip planner and alert component simplify the home screen into the most common functions so that a new rider can easily plan their trip, see route updates, and understand the main rules of using public transportation. A more adventurous and seasoned SEPTA rider can explore Philly using SEPTA, or look into the history of the service.

The cover design illustrates the psychological violence through giant hands interacting with the title and red labrinth. The Sympathizer similarly is politically charged, as it follows the dark yet comedic confession of a half-French, half-Vietnamese man serving as a spy for the Communist forces in the final days of the Vietnam War. Bridging  the man’s face across back cover, spine, and front cover, the result is a face that stares back at you however you turn the book. The cover design also nods to the Vietnam flag in a combined lighthearted yet serious tone the book takes on.",

We also decided to respect the client’s cash only payment process, and decided to emphasize this in the app user flow when ordering a food item. On my personal end, I was responsible for the logo and illustration, and contributed heavily to the aesthetic and component design such as icons, buttons, fonts, and colors. The focus of the project included user testing, and it was enlightening to see how users interacted with the prototype. The final app is a result of many revisions and collaborative efforts.",
