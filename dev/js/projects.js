With the rhythm of blackletter typography, shattered panes of hyper-saturated artwork and architecture, and the background grid phasing in and out from the foreground, the design brings to life the diverse beauty of the MET Cloisters and explodes its history into view.

        process_description: "The MET Cloisters is a beautiful medieval art museum in Manhattan that I had the privilege of visiting in the summer of 2021. The most notable thing about the Cloisters is that like most art museums, it sources all of its artwork from around the globe, but unlike other art museums, its artwork includes entire medieval facades. The process for this infographic poster started with gathering images of the most popular facades and art works and playing with their hue in order to represent a stained glass window. I then tried to “shatter” the images to present a cynical eye to the act of curation, which is explained by the quote at the bottom of the poster: 'Perhaps the supreme example of curatorial genius working in exquisite harmony with vast wealth.'",

By peering through the die-cut holes in the page, the reader can trace the soul of language which connects all these writings from the origins of civilization to the current day. Each page exists as a work of art on its own, and yet leads into the next through the holes in its surface; every page exists in constant conversation with the whole publication. As the climatic poetic essay in the middle of Mythos states in the reveal of a gate fold, “Consciousness is formed from the dialogue of people",

The holes die-cut into the pages become bigger as you read, symbolizing the idea of the soul’s journey from birth to death. As poetry is an intimate experience between poet to reader, the journey of language and the soul are intertwined, just as each poem intertwines into the next in the interaction of the holes between pages.",

The final chapter was called “Crown”, as it concerned Basquiat’s untimely death and his legacy. The fourth chapter, “Skull”, shows Basquiat’s painting, “Untitled Skull” disappearing with every flip of the page. In order to do this, I cut apart a print out of the painting and layered it with quotations from art critics to hone in on the paranoia Basquiat experienced which led him to ultimately destroy some of his art works.",

Finally, it raises questions of who is actually consuming art and asks how representational of its community is the art museum.",

As Danto stated in his essay “The Artworld”, “To see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry: an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an artworld.” This exhibit plays with the idea of the art museum as the art world and the definer of fine art. I was greatly inspired by Banksy who shredded his artwork which was being sold (without him receiving any payment), and decided the best way to critique the institution was to shred it. I gathered famous pieces of graffiti set with a primary color, and typographically, played off Barbara Kruger’s political and graphic tone.",

Personally, I created the logo and digital assets and collaborated on the QR Code Wall Mural with Julia, and we had a timeline of 1.5 weeks to complete the project. Our main concept was to tie the three exhibits together in an unconventional way to fit our unconventional art exhibits. Therefore, we borrowed the street graffiti aesthetic from my exhibit, This Is Not An Exhibition, and also pushed for a tech-y digital aesthetic inspired from George’s exhibit, Prosthetic Aesthetics, and came to the conclusion of the QR Code Wall Mural and arrow motif. People would first see this massive wall mural to pique their interest, and be prompted to scan the QR code which would bring up a website on their phone which would start their journey of following the arrows to each exhibit.",

The most important thing was to make it easy to use for someone who had never used public transportation before, so I included a trip planner on the home page akin to Google Maps’ Trip Planner. I also wanted to make sure route alers were displayed on the home page as it’s another extremely important function of a public transportation website.",

The Sympathizer similarly is politically charged, as it follows the dark yet comedic confession of a half-French, half-Vietnamese man serving as a spy for the Communist forces in the final days of the Vietnam War. Bridging  the man’s face across back cover, spine, and front cover, the result is a face that stares back at you however you turn the book.

For the Sympathizer, I really wanted to show the colors of the Vietnamese flag, similar to the actual book cover, but wanted to bring in more of a humanness with the image of a smirking face.
